1. The Game was too easy

2. Increasing the size and speeof the balls and decreasing the hitbox of the goals would make this harder.

3. Visuals like better textures, particle effects and sound effects would give the "wow" factor.

4. Needing to position myself in the correct way to bounce the ball into the goal was fun.

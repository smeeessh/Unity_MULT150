/*
1. The game is not hard. The disjointed player hitbox means the player themselves can't collect the power ups themselves, making the game slightly
unresponsive. Controlling the player is also a bit difficult since the player has no friction.

2. I would move the player hitbox slightly closer to the player and make the obstacles slightly larger.
3. Sound effects for things like phasing or getting hit and visual effects like speed lines near the border of the screen would give it the "wow" factor.
4. The game gets more fun the closer you are to losing time
5. The more time you have, the less risk there is to getting hit
